## ⭐ Highlights from My Repositories

Below are some repositories I’m proud to share. Click to explore them:

- **[From Query-Based Segment Retrieval to Answer Generation in Egocentric 
Videos](https://github.com/Group69-MLDL/MLDLProject)**

  An egocentric video question answering pipeline, combining temporal event localization with multimodal vision-language models, achieving accurate and context-aware responses.

- **[GLIMPSE-ASTERISKS](https://github.com/Asterisks-NLP/GLIMPSE-ASTERISKS)**

  An enhanced version of the GLIMPSE summarization framework, incorporating novel modifications to improve the extraction of common and unique viewpoints from multiple peer reviews.

- **[Object Detector](https://github.com/arvinesmaeily/ObjectDetector)**

  A cross-platform .NET MAUI application that performs real-time object detection using YOLOv11 models. Built with ONNX Runtime for hardware-accelerated neural network inference on Windows, Android, iOS, and macOS.

- **[ResNet-CNN-CIFAR10](https://github.com/arvinesmaeily/ResNet-CNN-CIFAR10)**

  A complete PyTorch implementation of a custom CNN and a ResNet-based architecture for classifying images in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

- **[MoodPlayer](https://github.com/arvinesmaeily/MoodPlayer)**

  MoodPlayer is a Recommender System that uses smartphone sensor data and the meta data of music to select and recommend the most desirable music based on the type of driver and affect his mood and driving.
  
- **[COVID19-Patient-Health_Predicition](https://github.com/arvinesmaeily/COVID19-Patient-Health_Predicition)**
 
  This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the health status of COVID-19 patients. The goal is to optimize resource allocation in healthcare settings by accurately forecasting patient outcomes based on their clinical and demographic data.

- **[Stock Market Trend Prediction](https://github.com/arvinesmaeily/StockMarketTrendPrediction)**

  Predicting the trend of a stock on the Iranian Stock Exchange using LSTM and GRU Neural Networks on TSETMC Time-Series Dataset.

- **[Fluent SSH](https://github.com/arvinesmaeily/FluentSSH)**

  A modern Windows application for creating a secure SOCKS5 proxy tunnel over SSH. Built with WinUI 3 and the Windows App SDK, Fluent SSH is the next‑generation successor to [SSH‑Direct‑Client](https://github.com/arvinesmaeily/SSHDirectClient), redesigned from the ground up with a native Fluent Design experience.

- **[SSHDirectClient(Discontinued)](https://github.com/arvinesmaeily/SSHDirectClient)**  

  A WPF-based Windows application that creates a secure SOCKS5 proxy tunnel to a remote server. It's designed to be a simple, graphical alternative to the ssh -D or ssh -L command.
